### Core skills:

1. Swift
    * language
2. SwiftUI
    * provide tools to create apps using the language
    * it's a framework built on top of Swift
    * works everywhere. Ideantical code is likely to be found for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS.
    * SwiftUI is the future. 
    * built for Swift
3. Working with data
4. Networking
5. Version control

### Extension skills:

1. UIKit
    * built for Apple's older language, ObjectiveC
    * old companies probably has code written using UIKit
    * UIKit can do many things SwiftUI cannot
    * more code realted solutions in UI kit than SwiftUI
2. Core Data
    * Apple's framework for storing application data
    * Links up to iCloud
    * not very pleasant to work with; quite old, as much as ObjectiveC.
    * Hundreds or thousands of apps written using Core Data.
3. Testing
    * special code that tests main app code
    * makes sure the main app continues to work correctly after changes in the main app code
4. Architecture
    * about the way we write our code
    * proven techniques to structure your code
    * design patterns
    * how you breakup your code
    * much more subjective
    * obvious no right way
5. Multithreading
    * practice of making your code do more than one thing at a time
    * may make run code 3 or 4 times faster
    * in some cases, code may run slower


### Common mistakes:
1. memorizing everything
2. shiny object syndrome
3. lone wolf learning
4. using beata software
5. relying on Apple's documentation
6. getting lost in Objective-C
7. Taking shots at other languages
